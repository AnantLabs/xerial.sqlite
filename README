- Install cygwin with make, curl, unzip 
- Install MinGW64

= How to build pure-java library
- Use Mac OS X or Linux with gcc-3.x
- make purejava
- the build will fail due to the broken regex libray, so copy the non-corrupted archive I downloaded:
  $ cp archive/regex3.8a.tar.gz target/build/nestedvm-2009-08-09/upstream/downlolad/
- then do 'make purejava' again.
